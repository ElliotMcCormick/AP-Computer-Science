    1. you would need a deck of cards (minus the jokers - so 52),
        a desk, a brain, and hands.
        private instance variables needed: number of cards. type of cards
            (can't be like a pinochle deck), number of cards down on the table,
            size of table.
    
    2. if there are two card that add to eleven || three face cards
            a play is possible
       else
            game over
    
       when the two that add to eleven or three face are selected
            remove them and deal new cards
    
       repeat.
    
    3. yes. minus a GUI
    
    4. a) in the constructor, and in the newGame method
       b) anotherPlayIsPossible and isLegal
       c) 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
       d) for (Integer index : cIndexes){
              System.out.prinln(cards[index]);
          }
       e) anotherPlayIsPossible, you need to know which indexes to
            look at to check the methods
